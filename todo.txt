- did not investigate if default country and the currency is set with client IP
- testing could be used for parsing product pages
	- page would be downloaded and stored in the repository
	- test cases and util methods would read and parse the local file
	- required assertions would be added to test cases
	- in a case when product pages are changed (ie. HTML changes), then the new file
	  could be downloaded and tested before new deployment and crawler run
- logging should be better and should conform to lyst way of logging (most likely logs are gathered
on a central location)
