- did not investigate if default country and currency is set with client IP
- tdd could be used for parsing product pages
  - page would be downloaded and stored in repository
  - test cases and util methods would read and parse the local file
  - required assertions would be added to test cases
  - in a case when product pages are changed (ie. html changes), then the new file
    could be downloaded and tested before new deployment and crawler run
- logging should be better and should confiorm to lyst (most likely you gather logs
  on central location)
